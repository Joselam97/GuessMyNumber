# 🔢 Guess The Number Game

A simple and interactive number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The project provides instant feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players have a limited number of attempts to get the correct answer.
